## 1.1 Proportional hazard assumption----
### 1.1.1 Test----
#### Testing the proportional hazard assumptions is consistent.
#### All co-variables should have a non-significant test.
cox.zph(cox_aic)
cox.zph(cox_bic)
#### In both cases, except for the monocytes,
#### all covariates are significant (in some cases even strongly significant),
#### so that the proportional hazard assumption may not apply.

### 1.1.2 Schoenfeld Residuals over time for seperate covariates----
#### The Schoenfeld residuals should scatter around 0 over time
#### (covariates are independent of time when proportional hazards are assumed)
#### and should have a uniform variability.

#dev.off()

#### In contrast to the tests from 1.1.1, the coefficients in both models are well distributed,
#### lying at 0 on the one hand and scattering fairly evenly (except for the edges) on the other.
